IPNA data project: comparison of energy production from fossil vs renewable sources from 1975 to 2015 using data retrieved via the publicly available world bank api. Comparison is available by region: EU, North America, Latin America &amp; Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa.
Motivation: sustainable development goal 7 stipulates the need for 'access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all'. It takes motivation from the critical impacts of escalated GHG emissions that are severely putting pressure on sustained life on earth and cause up to 5 million premature deaths per year according to Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy). Thus, rapidly shifting from fossil to renewable sources of energy is crucial to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change caused by energy production and consumption.
